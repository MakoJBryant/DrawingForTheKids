-- Name

Drawing for the Kids Charity Website


-- Description

An Azure-hosted ASP.NET Core web app where children's drawings are sold and donations made to help struggling schools in Guatemala.


-- Motivation

While a good challenge is motivation enough, the drive behind this project actually came from the accomplishments of an inspirational young girl.
On January of 2019, Debbie (who was six years old) started selling her drawings to raise money for rural schools in Guatemala. After six months, there were more than 100 drawings sold and Debbie was able to go back to Guatemala and deliver 150 desks to three schools. Now I am working to build a cross-platform website where Debbie's story can be told and more money can be raised for this cause.
